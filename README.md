# My City

This project hosts a simple website with information and activities for visitors. Activities can be booked directly on the site and a map shows where they take place.

## Getting Started

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The page lists activities available in the city. Click on "Book" to submit a booking and view the map for location details.
